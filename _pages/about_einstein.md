I am an AI Engineer at [FPT Software](https://www.fpt-software.com/)'s AI Innovation Center (AI1), where I develop and maintain multi-agent systems using orchestration frameworks for building long-running and stateful agents. I specialize in backend integration with automated workflows for scalable AI systems.

Previously, I was an AI Research Resident at [FPT Software](https://www.fpt-software.com/)'s AI Innovation Center (AI1) (Aug 2023 - Jul 2025), where I investigated multimodal generative AI for diverse applications, including text-to-image and LLM-based recommender systems. During this time, I resolved ambiguous search queries on an e-commerce site by proposing a hybrid ranking method that combines semantic and full-text search. My research has been published in top-tier venues including **EMNLP 2024** and **WACV 2026**.

I also served as a Research Assistant at the [Center for Environmental Intelligence (CEI)](https://vinuni.edu.vn/research/center-for-environmental-intelligence-cei/) at VinUniversity (Apr 2024 - Jul 2025), where I developed methods to automate material discovery using AI and high-throughput robotics, resulting in publications in two Q1 journals (**Nature Synthesis** with IF 20.0 and **Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices** with IF 6.8).

I graduated as **Salutatorian** (ranked 2nd/153) from the Computer Science Department at VNU University of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of 3.86/4.0.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **multi-agent systems**, **multimodal generative AI**, **large language models**, and **AI for scientific discovery**. I am particularly passionate about building intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems in domains ranging from e-commerce to materials science.

Throughout my career, I have been honored with several prestigious awards, including the "Student with Five Good Merits" Certificate at the Central Level (awarded to only 85 students nationwide), First Prize in the AI4VN Challenge 2022, and recognition as a National Outstanding Female Student in Science and Technology 2021.
